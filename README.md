My name is Dazbo. To earn a living, I work as an Enterprise Cloud Architect. **I love all things Google Cloud!** 
I dabble in a bit of coding, but only for fun, and so that I don't look like a complete idiot when talking to coders and engineers!

  - Enhancing my [Rickbot](https://github.com/derailed-dash/rickbot-adk) multipersonality chatbot, built using Google ADK and Gemini, and deployed to Google Cloud Run. Play with it [here](https://rickbot.co.uk).
